Welcome to Epiphany BSP's documentation!
========================================

Epiphany BSP is a library for developing applications for the `Parallella board <https://www.parallella.org>`_. It is easy to setup and use, and provides powerful mechanisms for writing optimized parallel programs.

This documentation provides an introduction to each component of the
Epiphany BSP (EBSP) library. Each section introduces a number of new EBSP functions
which we call *primitives* through an example. At the end of each section the
new primitives are summarized and detailed documentation is provided for them. After reading only a couple of sections you will be able to write simple programs for the Parallella.
We also provide a complete reference of the API and a short introduction to the formal BSP model.

The EBSP library is released under the LGPLv3. The `source code <https://github.com/coduin/epiphany-bsp>`_ and `issue tracker <https://github.com/coduin/epiphany-bsp/issues>`_ are both hosted on GitHub. The latest `EBSP release <http://www.github.com/coduin/epiphany-bsp/releases>`_ is |release|.
